# Backsaw

[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/PRX/backsaw.prx.org.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/PRX/backsaw.prx.org)

Backsaw is a utility for inspecting and analyzing flighting behavior in the [Adzerk](http://adzerk.com/) [Native Ad API](http://help.adzerk.com/hc/en-us/sections/200425759-Native-Ads-API).


## Development

Development of Backsaw should be done using Node 6.x.

### Setup

Install prerequisites and development and application dependencies:

```
npm i -g npm
npm install
```

_Note: `npm install` writes a git pre-commit hook to `./.git/hooks`._

### Contributions

New development dependencies should be installed with npm, eg:

```
npm install gulp-gravitationalwaves --save-dev
```

New application dependencies should be installed with [jspm](http://jspm.io/), eg:

```
jspm install angular2
```

_(Following this Readme will install jspm locally, so the `jspm` command likely will not be available if you do need to run `jspm install`. There are several options for getting access to that command, but the easiest is installing `jspm` globally if you do need to add dependencies.)_

### Running

`npm start` runs the app without compiling jspm dependencies, and uses the typescript files directly.

`npm run start:dist` imitates a production release, by building a single file executable (ES5) from the jspm dependencies, and running the local server out of the `./.dist` directory, which contains copies of all files needed for a deployment.

## Deployment

`npm run deploy` updates the `./.dist` directory, including the sfx bundle from jspm and any other app files, and pushes the files to S3. ***Use sparingly***, as it currently provides no protections against anything, and will deploy a broken feature branch without complaining.

In order for a deploy to work, you should have your `~/.aws` credentials set up to have access to the application's S3 bucket.

## Notes

* The Typescript compiler will complain about imports from `angular` and `rxjs` (and other libraries) if they are only installed with JSPM. While `tsc` can find modules from NPM, it can't find modules from JSPM. If you don't want to see loads of errors when compiling (or when your IDE is compiling behind the scenes) you should `npm install` `angular2` and `jspm` until `tsc` adds support for JSPM, which is in progress (as of 3/24/2016).
